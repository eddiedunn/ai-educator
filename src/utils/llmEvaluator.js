They prevent double-spending and maintain the integrity of the blockchain. Common mechanisms include Proof of Work (used by Bitcoin), which requires computational effort to validate transactions, and Proof of Stake (used by Ethereum 2.0), which selects validators based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and are willing to 'stake' as collateral.",
    "Smart contract security refers to practices and measures designed to protect smart contracts from vulnerabilities and exploits. Since smart contracts are self-executing and immutable once deployed, security flaws can lead to significant financial losses. Common security issues include reentrancy attacks, integer overflow/underflow, and front-running. Developers use formal verification, code audits, and security best practices to mitigate these risks."
